//! Rust implementation of AluVM (arithmetic logic unit virtual machine) and assembler from Alu
//! Assembly language into bytecode.
//!
//! AluVM is a pure functional register-based highly deterministic & exception-less instruction set
//! architecture (ISA) and virtual machine (VM) without random memory access, capable of performing
//! arithmetic operations, including operations on elliptic curves. The AluVM ISA can be extended by
//! the environment running the virtual machine (host environment), providing an ability to load
//! data to the VM registers and support application-specific instructions (like SIMD).
//!
//! The main purpose for ALuVM is to be used in distributed systems whether robustness,
//! platform-independent determinism are more important than the speed of computation. The main area
//! of AluVM applications (using appropriate ISA extensions) is blockchain environments,
//! consensus-critical computations, multiparty computing (including deterministic machine
//! learning), client-side-validation, sandboxed Internet2 computing, and genetic algorithms.
//!
//! For more details on AluVM, please check [the specification][AluVM]
//!
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The robustness lies at the very core of AluVM. It is designed to avoid any
//! undefined behavior. Specifically,
//! * All registers may be in the undefined statel
//! * Impossible/incorrect operations put destination register into a special *undefined state*;
//! * Code always extended to 2^16 bytes with zeros, which corresponds to no-operation;
//! * There are no invalid jump operations;
//! * There are no invalid instructions;
//! * Cycles & jumps are counted with 2^16 limit (bounded-time execution);
//! * No ambiguity: any two distinct byte strings always represent strictly distinct programs;
//! * Code is always signed;
//! * Data segment is always signed;
//! * Code commits to the used ISA extensions;
//! * Libraries identified by the signature;
//! * Code does not run if not all libraries are present;
//!
//! ![Comparison table](doc/comparison.png)
//!
//!
//! ## Instruction Set Architecture
//!
//! ![Instruction set architecture](doc/isa.png)
//!
//! ### Instruction opcodes
//!
//! One will find all opcode implementation details documented in [`isa::Instr`] API docs.
//!
//! - RISC: only 256 instructions
//! - 3 families of core instructions:
//!   * Control flow
//!   * Data load / movement between registers
//!   * ALU (including cryptography)
//! - Extensible with ISA extensions: 127 of the operations are reserved for extensions
//!   * More cryptography
//!   * Custom data I/O (blockchain, LN, client-side-validation)
//!   * Genetic algorithms / code self-modification
//!   
//! The arithmetic ISA is designed with strong robustness goals:
//! - Impossible arithmetic operation (0/0, Inf/inf) always sets the destination register into
//!   undefined state (unlike NaN in IEEE-754 it has only a single unique value)
//! - Operation resulting in the value which can't fit the bit dimensions under a used encoding,
//!   including representation of infinity for integer encodings (x/0 if x != 0) results in:
//!   * for float underflows, subnormally encoded number,
//!   * for x/0 if x != 0 on float numbers, Â±Inf float value,
//!   * for overflows in integer checked operations and floats: undefined value, setting `CK` to
//!     false,
//!   * for overflows in integer wrapped operations, modulo division on the maximum register value
//!
//! Most of the arithmetic operations has to be provided with flags specifying which of the encoding
//! and exception handling should be used:
//! * Integer encodings have two flags:
//!   - one for signed/unsigned variant of the encoding
//!   - one for checked or wrapped variant of exception handling
//! * Float encoding has 4 variants of rounding, matching IEEE-754 options
//!
//! Thus, many arithmetic instructions have 8 variants, indicating the used encoding (unsigned,
//! signed integer or float) and operation behavior in a situation when resulting value does not fit
//! into the register (overflow or wrap for integers and one of four rounding options for floats).
//!
//! Check [the specification][AluVM] for the details.
//!
//! ### Registers
//!
//! **ALU registers:** 8 blocks of 32 registers
//! - Integer arithmetic (A-registers) blocks: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 bits
//! - Float arithmetic (F-registers) blocks:
//!   * IEEE: binary-half, single, double, quad, oct precision
//!   * IEEE extension: 80-bit X87 register
//!   * BFloat16 register, used in Machine learning
//! - Cryptographic operations (R-registers) blocks: 128, 160, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 bits
//! - String registers (S-registers): 1 block of 256 registers, 64kb each
//!
//! **Control flow registers:**
//! - Status (`CK`), boolean (one bit)
//! - Cycle counter (`CY`), 16 bits
//! - Instruction complexity accumulator (`CA`), 16 bits
//! - Call stack register (`CS`), 3*2^16 bits (192kB block)
//! - Call stack pointer register (`CP`), 16 bits
